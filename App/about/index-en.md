Hey everyone! I'm Ma5hr00m, a college student studying in China.

I'm into **cybersecurity** and also work as a web full stack developer.

During my free time, I have a strong passion for anime production because I absolutely love watching Japanese anime!

I'm more of an introverted person and prefer online communication over face-to-face interactions. However, I realize that it's not ideal 😮‍💨, and there should be more interaction between people. So, I'm actively working on being more positive, outgoing, and trying to engage with others.

In MBTI Testing, My result is type **INFJ-T** in Personality .

Major in: Computer Science.
